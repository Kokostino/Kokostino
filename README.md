### Good Morning - Buenos Dias - صباح الخير - Bon Jour - Guten Morgen :boar:

- :palm_tree: I’m currently working on rebuilding Westermosque with Neural Style Transfer and GANs
- :milky_way: I’m interested in wildlife, nature, journaling and enjoying life
- :whale::dash: Fun fact: The name Kokostino is a wordplay based on supersymmetric name conventions and means the fermionic partner of a coconut (Kokosnuss in German)
