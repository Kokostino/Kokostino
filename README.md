### Good Morning - Buenos Dias - صباح الخير - Bon Jour - Guten Morgen :boar:


- :palm_tree: I’m currently learning about Graph Neural Networks and Go
- :milky_way: Fun fact: I was almost finished with my Bachelor's in Astrophysics when I figured out that "shooting stars make wishes come true" does not have a scientific base
- :mermaid: I’m interested in wildlife, nature, journaling, image processing and enjoying life
- :whale::dash: The name Kokostino is a wordplay based on supersymmetric name conventions and means the fermionic partner of a coconut (Kokosnuss in German)
